# CLI Maker for Python

This programme provides a boilerplate to build a CLI programme which packages python functions



# Usage 
Create a new script file which

- Create a script
- Import functions you want to provide as functions of the cli
    Let's say a command is entered, and a function is to be called. We can think of twe situations. 1. we have already have variables so that we can pass them in to the function we want to call and, 2. we have only some or none of variables ready, so that we have to further prompt the user to define them. In developers' persepective, in the first case, the programme can just proceed. In the second case, however , we have to provide an additional interface, which can be achieved by using PyCLIArgPrompt class.


- Import pyclimaker
- Instantiate(?) pyclimaker class
- Build with the accompanied command
