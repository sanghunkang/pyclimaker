# Getting Started
### Installation
### Building CLI command for function with no argument
### Building CLI command for function with one argument
### Building CLI command for function with multiple arguments
### Building CLI command for function with default arguments
### Building CLI command for function with predefined arguments
### Building CLI command for function with arguments which requires special interactions


# Usage 
Create a new script file which

- Create a script
- Import functions you want to provide as functions of the cli

Let's say a command is entered, and a function is to be called. We can think of twe situations. 1. we have already have variables so that we can pass them in to the function we want to call and, 2. we have only some or none of variables ready, so that we have to further prompt the user to define them. In developers' persepective, in the first case, the programme can just proceed. In the second case, however, we have to provide an additional interface, which can be achieved by using PyCLIArgPrompt class.

- Instantiate(?) pyclimaker objects and bind them
- Build the script into a CLI programme
